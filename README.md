# Paytm-Like App Learning Project

This project is designed for learning purposes to gain a better understanding of web development technologies such as React, React Router DOM, Context API, Recoil, Node.js, Express.js, Zod validation, and middleware.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/paytm-like-app.git
   cd paytm-like-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the server directory
   cd ../backend

   # Run the server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the client directory
   cd ../frontend

   # Run the frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts:

- **client**: Frontend built with React.
- **server**: Backend built with Node.js and Express.js.

### Frontend Structure

The frontend structure follows a modular approach, with components organized under the `src/components` directory. Key concepts covered in the frontend include:

- React Router DOM for navigation.
- Context API for state management.
- Recoil for additional state management.

### Backend Structure

The backend is structured to handle routes, validation, middleware, and more. Key concepts covered in the backend include:

- Node.js and Express.js for server development.
- Zod for validation of incoming data.
- Middleware for enhancing server functionality.
  -Jwt for login authentication.
